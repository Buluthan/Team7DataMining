While working on this project as a team of three, we encountered a few challenges that required us to separate the tasks and models into different files. The biggest issue we faced was working with an extremely large dataset, which exceeded the RAM capacities of our computers for certain models. To overcome this, we coded the models separately and trained them on a teammate's computer with 32GB of RAM, and then pushed the results to the repository.
